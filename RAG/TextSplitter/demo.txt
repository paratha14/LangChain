 A leg spinner's bowling action naturally creates opportunities for edges, mistimed shots, and catches on
 the leg side. The fielding positions should be set to maximize these chances while maintaining pressure
 on the batsman.
 Core Fielding Positions
 Close Catching Positions
 Slip (1st/2nd): Essential for edges from turning deliveries. Position slightly wider than for pace
 bowlers
 Leg Slip: Crucial for leg spinners - catches deflections off bat/pad on the leg side
 Short Leg: Close to the batsman on the leg side for bat-pad catches from sharp turn
 Silly Point: Aggressive position for catches off the face of the bat
